Exercise 2.2. 

1. Create a new program named Date.java.
Copy or type in something like the “Hello, World” program and make sure you can compile and run it.

---DONE. WORKS


2. Following the example in Section 2.4, write a program that creates variables named day, date, month and year. 
day will contain the day of the week and date will contain the day of the month. 

---DONE.


What type is each variable? 

DataTypes are as follows 

a) day : string
b) date : int 
c) month : string 
d) year : int

Assign values to those variables that represent today’s date.

---- DONE

3. Print the value of each variable on a line by itself. 
This is an intermediate step that is useful for checking that everything is working so far.

---DONE 


4. Modify the program so that it prints the date in standard American form: Saturday, July 16, 2011.

----DONE. Used string concatenation. The + operator was used to concatenate strings and integers together. 



5. Modify the program again so that the total output is:
     American format:
     Saturday, July 16, 2011
     European format:
     Saturday 16 July, 2011
     
 ----DONE 
 
The point of this exercise is to use string concatenation to display values with different types (int and String), 
and to practice developing programs gradually by adding a few statements at a time.
