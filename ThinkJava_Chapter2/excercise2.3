Exercise 2.3. 

1. Create a new program called Time.java. 
From now on, I wonâ€™t remind you to start with a small, working program, but you should.

---DONE


2. Following the example in Section 2.6, create variables named hour, minute and second, 
and assign them values that are roughly the current time. 
Use a 24-hour clock, so that at 2pm the value of hour is 14.

--DONE


3. Make the program calculate and print the number of seconds since midnight.

---DONE 


4. Make the program calculate and print the number of seconds remaining in the day.

---DONE



5. Make the program calculate and print the percentage of the day that has passed.

--DONE


6. Change the values of hour, minute and second to reflect the current time (I assume that some time has elapsed), 
and check to make sure that the program works correctly with different values.
