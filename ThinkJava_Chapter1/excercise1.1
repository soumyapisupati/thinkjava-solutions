Exercise 1.1. 

Computer scientists have the annoying habit of using common English words to mean something other than their common English meaning. 
For example, in English, statements and comments are the same thing, but in programs they are different.
The glossary at the end of each chapter is intended to highlight words and phrases that have special meanings in computer science. 
When you see familiar words, don’t assume that you know what they mean!


1. In computer jargon, what’s the difference between a statement and a comment?

Answer : 

A statement is an instruction that is to be read and executed by the computer.   
It tells the computer / cpu what is to be done - example how to perform a specific computation.   

A comment on the the other hand is ignored by the computer. It is written for the programmer / user. 
It gives additional information about a particular statement or set of statements for enhancing the understanding of the programmer or the reader. 
It is written keeping readability of the the program in mind. 


2. What does it mean to say that a program is portable?

Answer :

When a program is portable , we mean that a program can run on various different kinds of machines , 
platforms or computing environments and can generate the same results without needing to be changed/modified. 


3. What is an executable?

Answer :

An executable is an intermediate form of the source code that can be understood and is ready to be executed by the processor. 
The compiler takes in the high level source code and after checking for syntax errors generated the executable. 
In case of java - the executable is also known as the byte code (the .class file) and is then interpreted line-by-line the the JVM interpreter 
to generate the output/result.
