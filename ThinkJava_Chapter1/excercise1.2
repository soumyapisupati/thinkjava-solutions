Exercise 1.2. 

Before you do anything else, find out how to compile and run a Java program in your environment. 
Some environments provide sample programs similar to the example in Section 1.5.


1.Type in the “Hello, world” program, then compile and run it.

Observation : Program ran without any errors. Output is Hello, world.


2.Add a print statement that prints a second message after the “Hello, world!”. 
Something witty like, “How are you?” Compile and run the program again.

Observation : Program ran without any errors. Output is given below. 

Hello, world.
How are you?

They are both printed on two separate lines. 


3. Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again. The new comment should not affect the result.

Observation : Put in a comment between both the print statements. It did not affect the output.
