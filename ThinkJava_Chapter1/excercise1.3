This exercise may seem trivial, but it is the starting place for many of the programs we will work with.
 
To debug with confidence, you have to have confidence in your programming environment. 

In some environments, it is easy to lose track of which program is executing, 
and you might find yourself trying to debug one program while you are accidentally running another. 

Adding (and changing) print statements is a simple way to be sure that 
the program you are looking at is the program you are running


Exercise 1.3.
 
It is a good idea to commit as many errors as you can think of, so that you see what error messages the compiler produces. 

Sometimes the compiler tells you exactly what is wrong, and all you have to do is fix it.

But sometimes the error messages are misleading. 

You will develop a sense for when you can trust the compiler and when you have to figure things out yourself.

 
 
1. Remove one of the open squiggly-braces.
Observation :Removed the brace after public static void main(String[] args).
Got an error on that line without having to explicitly compile/run. 
Got the following error : Syntax error on token ")", { expected after this token



2. Remove one of the close squiggly-braces.
Observation : Removed the brace that closes that class - the last one. 
Got an error on the previous line number without having to explicitly compile/run. 
Got the following error : Syntax error, insert "}" to complete ClassBody


3. Instead of main, write mian.
Observation : Changed to mian and ran the program. 
Got the following error : 
Error: Main method not found in class HelloWorld, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

This is a runtime error - not a syntax error (since the error occurred only after running the program.)

 
4. Remove the word static.
Observation : Had to run the program - this is a runtime error too. Got the following error : 

Error: Main method is not static in class HelloWorld, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)

Conclusion : The main method must always be static for some reason ? Why ? 


5. Remove the word public.
Observation : Had to run the program - this is a runtime error too.Got the following error : 

Error: Main method not found in class HelloWorld, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

Conclusion : This is the same error as that found in 3. Unless the main method is declared public - it wont be found. 
So does that mean that the default access specifier for a method is private ?


6. Remove the word System.
Observation : Removed System. This is a syntax error - dint need to explicitly run the program. 
Got the following error : 
Error : Multiple markers at this line
	- out cannot be resolved
	- Syntax error on token ".", delete this token



7. Replace println with Println.
Observation : Replaced. Once again syntax error. 
Got the following error on Println : The method Println(String) is undefined for the type PrintStream. 
3 quick fixes available : change to println , or print or add a typecast to System.out. 


8. Replace println with print. This one is tricky because it is a logic error, not a syntax error. 
The statement System.out.print is legal, but it may or may not do what you expect.

Observation : Changed from println to print. Very interesting !. 

Commented out the second print statement and tried printing. Got the following output : Hello,world. 

Now uncommented the second line and printed. Got the following output : Hello, world.How are you?

Conclusion : println is similar to \n in C. It will position the cursor on a new line once it is done printing the current line.  
print wont do that. It prints the next print statement in the same line too. 
This was an example of a semantic error ( not getting the expected putput).  

9. Delete one of the parentheses. Add an extra one.
Observations : Syntax errors. 

Delete parenthesis : Syntax error, insert ")" to complete Expression

Add parenthesis : Syntax error on token ")", delete this token
