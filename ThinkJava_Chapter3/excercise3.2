Exercise 3.2. The point of this exercise is to practice reading code and to make sure that 
you understand the flow of execution through a program with multiple methods.

1. What is the output of the following program? 
Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.

HINT: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

Answers

ping() : prints a period / full stop when invoked and then adds a new line 
and moves the cursor to the next line of the display. 

baffle() : prints the following output - wug. Then takes the cursor to the next line. 

Output of the program :
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

2. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

DONE
