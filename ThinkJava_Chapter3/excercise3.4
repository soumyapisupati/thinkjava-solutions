The purpose of this exercise is to take code from a previous exercise 
and encapsulate it in a method that takes parameters. 

You should start with a working solution to Exercise 2.2.


1. Write a method called printAmerican that takes the day, date, month and year as parameters 
and that prints them in American format.

DONE

2. Test your method by invoking it from main and passing appropriate arguments. 

The output should look something like this (except that the date might be different):
     Saturday, July 16, 2011

DONE

3. Once you have debugged printAmerican, write another method 
called printEuropean that prints the date in European format.

DONE
